# Data-Analysis-for-PowerCo

PowerCo is an Electricity and gas utility company that wants to understand the reason for their client churn.<br />
To get started into this analysis, first step is to install my libraries- Pandas,Matplotlib,numpy, and seaborn<br />
Then, i viewd my descriptive analysis using describe(), Info(), head() function to have a good understanding of the data i am working with.<br />
I had two datasets to work with. The client dataset and price dataset. I merged them with pd.merge function.<br />

# My Exploratory Data Analysis

I analyzed the number of Retained(i sometimes refer them as non-churn) clients verses churned clients<br />
I analyzed the average prices for different peroids and did a bar plot with its values for  churn and retained clients.<br />
I used correlative matrix to view the correlation between churn and differnt periods.<br />
I explored churn by channel sales<br />
Defined a plot distribution function and created a histogram to view distribution status(normal, skewness, bimodal)<br />
A boxplot to view outliers<br />
